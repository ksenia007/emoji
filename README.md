# Emoji flow

Visualizing the emoji used on Twitter: https://ksenia007.github.io/emoji/

The Python code looks up Emojis based on the search lines. Currently, they are saved as .txt for *Yoga* and *March Madness*

Then, use p5js to let the user select which topic to see and show emojis flowing up the screen.
